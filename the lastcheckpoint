As I reflect on my journey, I remember the nights in Luacjang, where the darkness brought our productivity to a standstill. Predators roamed, and students like me had no light to study. Out of necessity and curiosity, I began experimenting with discarded batteries and wires. After several shocks and failed attempts, I eventually built a simple lighting device that helped protect our cattle and allowed us to keep learning at night.

That small spark of light lit a much bigger fire inside me â€” the realization that learning isnâ€™t just about books and theories, but about solving real problems. From that point on, I saw education as a tool for transformation â€” not only of communities but of myself.

 My vision has grown: from lighting my community to building digital solutions that solve broader challenges. I want to use technology to improve lives â€” whether through smart irrigation, local logistics, or empowering refugee communities like my own.

ðŸ’» Skills I Have Gained During the Bootcamp

Through the Bootcamp, I have developed foundational and practical skills in:
Web Development
HTML, CSS (including Flexbox & Grid)
JavaScript (basics, DOM manipulation, and interactive elements)
Version Control
Git and GitHub (cloning, committing, pushing, and pull requests)
Project Development
Using VS Code to build and test real-world projects
Collaborating and organizing code for maintainability
Problem Solving
Debugging code efficiently
My goal is to specialize further in full-stack development and build software solutions that directly impact underserved communities. I want to focus on smart agriculture, digital education, and peacebuilding platforms. I believe that with the right tools and environment â€” like a university or tech accelerator â€” I can transform local problems into scalable solutions.
